# Applied Machine Learning (IAI5101)

This repository contains coursework for the *IAI5101: Foundations of Machine Learning for Engineers & Scientists* course offered in Winter 2024. It includes completed Jupyter Notebooks for **Assignment 1** and **Assignment 2**.

## üìÅ Contents

### Assignment 1 ‚Äì Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- **Goal:** Predict the compressive strength of concrete using ML models.
- **Techniques used:**
  - Data cleaning and z-score normalization
  - Correlation analysis and feature engineering
  - Regression modeling: KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost
  - Ensemble model: Voting Regressor
  - Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, MSE, R¬≤
  - Clustering with K-means and Silhouette analysis

### Assignment 2 ‚Äì NLP & Deep Learning
- **Goal:** Classify customer complaint narratives by product/service category.
- **Techniques used:**
  - Text preprocessing, stop word removal, tokenization
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with bar plots, word clouds, etc.
  - Class balancing and train-validation split
  - Deep learning: Bi-LSTM with word embeddings
  - Traditional models: Naive Bayes, Random Forest
  - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

## üõ† Requirements
